<h1 align="center">Hi, I'm Alessandro 👋</h1>

### 🧠 About Me

I'm a developer passionate about **cybersecurity**, **local AI systems**, and **multi-agent architectures**.  
My work focuses on building **modular**, **autonomous**, and **privacy-respecting infrastructures**.

- ⚙️ Languages: **Rust**, **Python**, **C/C++**, **JavaScript**, **TypeScript**, **React**, **HTML**
- 🧠 Areas: Local LLMs, RAG pipelines, multi-agent orchestration, AI toolchains
- 🔐 Domains: Offensive security tooling, red team automation, secure-by-design systems
- 🧬 Platforms: Custom Linux (Arch), Windows libs, terminal-centric workflows, full local control
- 🛠️ Tools: cybersecurity tools, all integrated into AI agent workflows

---

### 🔍 Focus Areas

- 🤖 Local-first AI systems (LLMs, RAG, agents — no cloud)
- 🧩 Multi-agent orchestration with planning, tool usage, and contextual awareness
- 🔧 Infrastructure-as-code for red teaming and AI-powered data workflows
- 💻 Designing a cyberpunk-inspired desktop environment with a secure and efficient architecture
- 🔍 Transparent and reproducible toolchains using open weights and open standards

---

### 🌐 Philosophy

> All of my projects are **fully open source** — I believe in free access to knowledge, community-driven innovation, and transparent technology.

No paywalls. No black boxes. Just reproducible systems, well-documented and free to build upon.
